SEE ABOVE FILES IN THE CODE FOR MY SUBMISSION TO THE INTERVIEW ASSESSMENT. 

I WAS UNABLE TO ACCESS THE API POSTS THROUGH AN ANDROID EMULATOR SO I WAS UNABLE TO TEST THE FUNCTIONALITY AND FIX ANY BUGS THAT MAY HAVE COME UP. I WROTE ESSENTIALLY THE SKELETON 
OF MY SOLUTION. IF GIVEN MORE TIME I COULD HAVE GOTTEN THE EMULATOR TO READ THE POSTS AND BE BALE TO FINE TUNE THE APP. I ALSO DID NOT INCLUDE ANY STYLE COMPONENTS FOR THE SAKE OF TIME. 

MY ANSWERS TO THE REVIEW IS IN A TEXT FILE CALLED "REVIEW NOTES" WITHIN THE REVIEW FOLDER. 

THANK YOU FOR THE OPPURTUNITY FOR AN INTERVIEW AND TO COMPLETE THIS ASSESSMENT.
