My suggestions for improving the code are as follows:

- When rendering the list of robots a unique key should be assigned to each robot for easier identifying and to eliminate the error

- It is a small list of data however for future proofing a Flat List should be used instead of Scrollview to optimize performance
  especially if a larger  data set is used in the future.

-App.js:31 viewRobo function not used

- style objects should be created for elements that have similar/ the same style properties. This will make the code cleaner,
and will make it faster to code in the future

- App.js:1 Component does not need to be specified in the import field with the React import

-App.js:36 years array not in use and can be deleted

- I would separate the code out of the App.js file adn into its own component file so that it is easier to add on to the app
in the future and it also allows you to easily add things such as Navigation components of more then one component was needed.
Adding the navigation component would also allow you to add a header to the screen eliminating the need for an unused View component on
line 62.

- App.js:73 Unnecessary return statement
